                us. <br>

            </p>
            <h3>7. To handle payments</h3>
            <p>
                When a User places an order, we only utilize the information they give us about themselves to fulfill that
                order. Except as required to deliver the service, we do not disclose this information to third parties.
            </p>

            <h3>9. Periodically send emails</h3>
            <p>
                We might use the email address to tell the User about their order updates and send them information.
                Inquiries, questions, and other requests could also be addressed using it. Users will take emails that may
                include company news, updates, details about relevant products or services, etc. if they choose to opt-in to
                our mailing list. If the User would ever like to stop receiving emails from us, we give comprehensive

                We occasionally employ other service providers to conduct business operations, such as distributing
                newsletters or surveys. If you have permitted us, we may disclose your information to these third parties
                for those specific, limited purposes. Outside, we do not share, rent, sell, trade, or divulge your personal
                information to any third-party businesses.
                <br>
